# DISPATCH INBOX — User → Claude

> **Asynchronous instruction queue.** Drop instructions for the next autonomous Claude session here. Claude's preflight script reads this at session start and processes any block under a `## INSTRUCTION` heading, then marks it `## DONE`, `## DEFERRED`, or `## RESPONDED` once handled.
>
> **Format:** Use the templates below. One instruction per `## INSTRUCTION` block. Anything outside an INSTRUCTION block is ignored.
>
> **Where to write from:** Phone (via GitHub mobile app or git web edit), real terminal, IDE — any tool that can edit a markdown file. The file is committed to git so changes sync across devices.

## How to use this

1. Add a new `## INSTRUCTION — <date> — <one-line summary>` block at the top.
2. Inside, give Claude the context. Be specific. Use the templates below.
3. Commit + push (or just save in workspace folder if you have a sync running).
4. Next autonomous session picks it up automatically.
5. After handling, Claude renames the heading to `## DONE — <date> — <summary>` and adds a `### Result` section underneath. Status becomes part of the git history.

## Severity tags (optional, in INSTRUCTION title)

- `[urgent]` — handle in the very next session, even if it's the daily catalog session
- `[blocking]` — don't start any other work until this is done
- `[opportunistic]` — fold in when convenient, no rush
- `[research]` — Claude should investigate + report back, not act

## Templates

### Add a bike to the catalog

```
## INSTRUCTION — YYYY-MM-DD — add bike: <make> <model> <year>
[opportunistic]

Spec source: <URL or "service manual" or "magazine test">
Key numbers: <hp / torque / mass / displacement>
Drivetrain: <chain pitch + sprocket if non-default>
Notes: <anything weird like 2T, shaft drive, etc>
```

### Investigate a bug

```
## INSTRUCTION — YYYY-MM-DD — investigate: <one-line problem statement>
[research]

Context: <where you noticed it>
Reproduction: <CLI / API call / test name>
Expected: <what should happen>
Actual: <what does happen>
Don't act yet — write findings to outbox and ask before fixing.
```

### Run a sweep / report

```
## INSTRUCTION — YYYY-MM-DD — sweep: <what kind>
[opportunistic]

Filter: <subset of bikes if any>
Output: reports/<filename>.md
Compare against: <prior report or benchmark>
```

### Direct task

```
## INSTRUCTION — YYYY-MM-DD — <verb>: <object>
[urgent | blocking | opportunistic]

<full description of what to do>
<any constraints>
<expected deliverable>
```
