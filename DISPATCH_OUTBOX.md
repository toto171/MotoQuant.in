# DISPATCH OUTBOX — Claude → User

> **Daily reports + alerts.** Claude appends an entry to this file at the end of every autonomous session. Read this when you sit down at the end of your work day to see what landed, what's blocked, and what needs your attention.
>
> **Format:** Newest entries at the bottom (chronological). Three severity levels:
>
> - `## SESSION` — normal end-of-session summary (what was committed, test status, deploy status)
> - `### ALERT` — non-fatal issue that didn't block but you should know about (e.g. backup PAT used, deploy verification timeout)
> - `## INCIDENT` — session aborted; needs your real-terminal intervention
>
> Trim entries older than 30 days periodically — git keeps the full archive.

## Setup — initial state — 2026-05-04

This file is now wired into the postflight script. Future autonomous sessions will append entries below.

What's in place:

- `scripts/session_preflight.sh` runs at session start: clones to /tmp, validates PAT, verifies baselines, reads DISPATCH_INBOX, acquires session mutex.
- `scripts/session_postflight.sh` runs at session end: runs focused tests, commits explicit-list, pushes with primary→backup PAT fallback, verifies Railway deploy via curl, syncs FUSE, releases mutex.
- `scripts/secrets_bootstrap.sh` is the one-time setup for `~/.motoquant-secrets/git-creds.env` (PRIMARY_PAT + BACKUP_PAT, never on FUSE).

What you need to do once:

1. Run `bash scripts/secrets_bootstrap.sh` from your real terminal to create the credentials file.
2. Add a calendar reminder to rotate PRIMARY_PAT every 30 days, BACKUP every 90.
3. Once verified, you can delete the PAT from `tokens.md` (preflight no longer reads it).

How to use this for daily comms:

- **From your phone or anywhere:** edit `DISPATCH_INBOX.md`, add an `## INSTRUCTION` block, commit. The next autonomous run will pick it up.
- **End of your day:** scroll to the bottom of this file (`DISPATCH_OUTBOX.md`) to see what Claude did. Anything tagged `### ALERT` or `## INCIDENT` deserves your attention.
